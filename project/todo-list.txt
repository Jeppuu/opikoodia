      TO DO:

    1. turn profile icon into a link href /profile
    2. fix up archive, my posts and profile pages
    3. start thinking about the rest api
    4. think about how to create dynamic posts
    5. log in page and user roles and identification
    6. make footer stay at the bottom of the page, it's annoying
